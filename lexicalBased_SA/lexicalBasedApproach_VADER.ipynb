    "* <b>Capitalization</b>: Using upper case letters to emphasize a sentiment-relevant word in the presence of other non-capitalized words, increases the magnitude of the sentiment intensity.\n",
    "* <b>Degree modifiers</b>: Also called intensifiers, they impact the sentiment intensity by either increasing or decreasing the intensity.\n",
    "* <b>Conjunctions</b>: Use of conjunctions like “but” signals a shift in sentiment polarity, with the sentiment of the text following the conjunction being dominant.\n",
    "* <b>!!!!!!! Preceding Tri-gram</b>: By examining the tri-gram preceding a sentiment-laden lexical feature, we catch nearly 90% of cases where negation flips the polarity of the text. A negated sentence would be “The food here isn’t really all that great”"
